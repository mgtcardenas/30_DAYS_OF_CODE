# 30 Days of Java Code

These are my answers to the [Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) 
tutorial path.

Answering these exercises is a great way to learn a given programming language
since it allows you to answer in many popular other programming languages such as
C/C++, Python, C#, etc.

All the solutions are formatted using Allman style and using both
the [Eclipse Code Formatter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546-eclipse-code-formatter)
and the [Tabifier](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/178-tabifier) plugins
which can all be downloadod for use with IntelliJ IDEA from the 
JetBrains plugin marketplace.

Feel free to use this code as you see fit.

**Note**: If the code looks unformatted try appending '?ts=4' into the URL.
This is because github uses Tab set to 8 spaces and I use it at 4
